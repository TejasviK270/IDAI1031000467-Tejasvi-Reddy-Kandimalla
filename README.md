**Project Overview**
CoachBot AI is a generative AI-powered web assistant developed for NextGen Sports Lab. It acts as a virtual personal coach to bridge the gap in professional sports training for youth athletes. The application provides personalized fitness plans, injury-safe recovery routines, and tactical advice tailored to an athlete’s specific sport, position, and physical condition.

**Research & Problem Definition**

**Goal**
The primary objective is to provide accessible, high-quality coaching to young athletes, particularly in under-resourced regions

**Key Research Findings**

Sport-Specific Needs: Research indicates that training must be tailored to the biomechanical demands of the sport (e.g., explosive power for basketball vs. endurance for middle-distance running).

Positional Requirements: Training styles differ significantly by role; for example, a goalkeeper requires agility and reaction-time drills, while a striker focuses on finishing and acceleration.

Injury Prevention: Youth athletes are prone to specific injuries like growth plate inflammation and ankle sprains; CoachBot adapts routines to be low-impact during recovery phases.

AI in Sports: Generative AI can simulate a coach’s knowledge by processing user metadata to generate structured, motivating, and safe outputs.

**Technical Implementation**
Model Configuration

Core Model: Gemini 1.5 Flash.

Hyperparameter Tuning: * Temperature (0.2 - 0.3): Set low to ensure conservative and medically safe training/nutrition advice.

Top-P/Top-K: Configured to maintain a balance between diversity in drills and factual coaching consistency.
